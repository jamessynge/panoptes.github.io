## Introduction

The aim is to assemble the head unit of PANOPTES, which should look like this when complete.  A specific parts list as advised by the PANOPTES team can be found above including the tools needed for the build. These are the parts that have been determined to work well for the purposes of this project. However, modifications or swaps for other components are fine, but will not be supported by the PANOPTES team. Feedback on the parts/instructions is welcomed and encouraged.

## Dovetail rail
* For this part please refer to the technical drawing for the [Dovetail]({{ site.url }}/tech_drawings/Dovetail.PDF).
* Mount the dovetail rail (EQD6) upside down in the vice (use rags so that the rail does not get scratched).
* Put a 7 mm drill bit in the cordless drill. Carefully drill out the central hole. Note, you need to place a strong force on the drill, hold it tightly and be careful as it may get stuck. If you have access to a drill press use it.
* Slowly step up the drill bit size until the central hole is 15 mm in diameter.

{% include question.html text="Do we still do the steps below?" %}

* From the dovetail technical drawing, it can be seen that there are two counter bored holes at 35.5 mm and 185.5 mm from the end of the rail.

{% include note.html text="Counter bored means the hole hides the head of a typical socket head screw." %}

* First drill through the rail with a 7.0 mm drill bit. Then use an 11.0 mm drill bit to create the counter bore. Drill it down to 6 mm below the surface of the rail.
* Use a deburring tool or a file to remove sharp edges.
* Remove from vice and set aside.

## Bottom mounting plate
* For this part refer to the [Camera Enclosure Mounting Plate 01]({{ site.url }}/tech_drawings/CameraEnclosureMountingPlate_01.PDF).
* Take one of the 12” long aluminum plates, mark a line 200 mm (7.87”) from one end of the plate.
* Mount it in the vice with the line facing up. Make sure the line is positioned outside the vice but within a few centimeters (an inch) of the edge of the vice.
* Use a hacksaw to cut off the short end. If you have a bandsaw use it.
* Once cut, use a large flat file to flatten the end and clean up the edges.
* Remove the plate from the vice.
* Mark all 7 hole positions as per Pan003.pdf. Make sure the marks are clearly seen and accurate to 0.5 mm.
* Place the plate back in the vice with marked side facing up.
* To drill out the central hole, start with a 6 mm drill bit and drill through the plate. Then step up the drill bit size to 10 and finally 13 mm. Debur the edges of the hole with a deburring tool or small round file.
* For the other 6 holes, use a 5.5 mm drill bit to drill through the plates.
* Use a M6 tap and tap the 5.5 mm diameter holes. Go slow, apply pressure, keep the tap perpendicular to the plates and use some lubrication if you have some.
* Check that the holes are ok by gently screwing in an M6 bolt into each.
* Remove plate from vice and set aside.

## Top mounting plate
* For this part refer to the [Camera Enclosure Mounting Plate 02]({{ site.url }}/tech_drawings/CameraEnclosureMountingPlate_02.PDF).
* Take another 12” long aluminum plate, mark a line 200 mm (7.87”) from one end of the plate.
* Mount it in the vice with the line facing up. Make sure the line is positioned outside the vice but within a few centimeters (an inch) of the edge of the vice.
* Use a hacksaw to cut of the short end. If you have a bandsaw use it.
* Once cut, use a large flat file to flatten the end and clean up the edges.
* Remove the plate from the vice.
* Mark all 7 hole positions as per Pan004.pdf. Make sure the marks are clearly seen and accurate to 0.5 mm.
* Place the plate back in the vice with marked side facing up.
* To drill out the central hole, start with a 6 mm drill bit and drill through the plate. Then step up the drill bit size to 10 and finally 13 mm. Debur the edges of the hole with a deburring tool or small round file.
* The 4 outside holes are counter bored for M6 socket head screws. Start by drilling out a 7 mm hole all the way through. Once this is complete, widen the hole to an 11 mm diameter down to a depth of 6 mm.
* The remaining 3 holes are all M6 tapped holes. Drill out a 5.5 mm hole for each. Then tap with an M6 tap as above.
* Check that the holes are ok by gently screwing in an M6 bolt into each.

## Camera mounting plate
* For this part refer to the [Camera Mounting Plate]({{ site.url }}/tech_drawings/CameraMountingPlate.PDF).
* Take another 12” long aluminum plate, mark a line 200 mm (7.87”) from one end of the plate.
* Mount it in the vice with the line facing up. Make sure the line is positioned outside the vice but within a few centimeters (an inch) of the edge of the vice.
* Use a hacksaw to cut of the short end. If you have a bandsaw use it.
* Once cut, use a large flat file to flatten the end and clean up the edges.
* Remove the plate from the vice.
* Mark the position of the 3 counter bored holes on the top surface (These are the lower 3 holes in the top view) and a central hole.
* Place the plate back in the vice with marked side facing up.
* To drill out the central hole, start with a 6 mm drill bit and drill through the plate. Then step up the drill bit size to 10 and finally 13 mm. Debur the edges of the hole with a deburring tool or small round file.
* The 3 counter bored holes are for M6 socket head screws. Start by drilling out a 7 mm hole all the way through. Once this is complete, widen the hole to an 11 mm diameter down to a depth of 6 mm.
* Remove the plate from the vice and turn over. Mark the position of the 2 counter bored holes that go on the bottom side (lower two holes in the bottom view image). Make sure to use the same reference surface when measuring the plate on the bottom side, its easy to make a mistake the plate is flipped.
* Place the plate back in the vice with marked side facing up.
* Start by drilling out a 7 mm hole all the way through. Once this is complete, widen the hole to an 11 mm diameter down to a depth of 6 mm.
* Remove the plate form the vice. Turn the plate up so that the top surface is up once again. Mark two straight lines perpendicular to the top edge of the plate that are tangential with the central hole (as per the top view of the drawing).
* Place the plate back in the vice so that the two marked lines are not between the vice clamps. Make sure the side of the plate with the lines is furthest away from you.
* Use a hacksaw and cut along the two lines until you reach the central hole.
* Once the two lines are cut and the block of aluminum has been removed, use a large flat file to smooth the surfaces and edges.
* Remove from vice and set aside.

## Camera enclosure box
* For this part refer to the [Camera Enclosure Box]({{ site.url }}/tech_drawings/CameraEnclosure_01.PDF).
* Open the lid to the enclosure and mark the position of the 5 holes on the bottom surface.
* By either placing it in a vice or having a colleague hold the box tightly, slowly drill out 8 mm diameter holes in the location of the 4 outer marks. Drill out a 13 mm hole for the central hole. If you use a vice, make sure to use rags to not damage the box.
* Next mark the position of the 2 large holes on the front surface of the box. To get the best results, push the left edge of the box (as per the bottom figure in Pan005.pdf) against a flat vertical surface. Mark the holes in the horizontal direction by using the vertical surface as a reference.
* Drill out two pilot holes with a 5 mm drill bit.
* Once again either mount the box in a vice or get a friend to hold it very tightly before you drill out the two large holes. Note the plastic is quiet soft and the drill goes through easily.
* Put the hole saw and associated drill bit into your cordless drill. While the box is being held, proceed to drill out the two large holes in the front panel. Best results are achieved when the drill is kept perpendicular to the surface and pressure is put on the drill while it is cutting. Hole saws can be very aggressive so be careful. The plastic box is relatively soft and the hole saw goes through with minimal effort.
* Use a small round file or deburring tool and clean up the edges of the two large holes.
* Finally, the latches for the lid will get in the way of the lens holes. Close the lid, and lock the latches. Observe how much they overlap with the hole and mark a straight line on the latches to reflect this.
* Use a hacksaw and carefully cut off a section of the latches to avoid vignetting the lens holes.

{% include note.html text="Once all steps above have been followed and completed, then it is very important to clean all machining fluids/greases and shards off all parts. Best results are achieved with a bath of warm soapy water. Let the parts soak for 10 minutes and then take them out and scrub them under a running tap. Dry them immediately to avoid oxidation/rust. To clean out the gunk and water in the holes, use ear buds." %}

## Assembly
* Place the Bottom mounting plate on top of the dovetail rail. Use two (2) M6 socket head screws to secure the rail to the bottom mounting plate from the bottom.
* Place the top mounting plate inside the enclosure, and the enclosure on top of the bottom mounting plate. Use 4 M6 socket head screws to secure the top plate to the bottom plate. Do not over tighten.
* Insert USB cables into the USB ports of the cameras. Its advised to use mini USB A – right angle mini USB B. Put the right angled end into the camera.
* Insert SD card into camera
* Plug AC power adapters into both cameras.
* Screw cameras to camera mounting plate by using ¼” -20 socket head screws from beneath the plate. They should be 3/8”  ¾” long.
* Screw the camera mounting plate to the top mounting plate with three (3) M6 socket head screws.
* Place Rokinon lenses on cameras.
* Place dust shields on the lenses.
