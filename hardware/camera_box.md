# Assembling the Camera Box

 {% include warning.html text="We do not advise people under the age of 18 to undertake this build without a parent or guardian present. In addition, although the build has been simplified so that most people can attempt it, a basic understanding and skill with everyday tools is necessary. If you are not familiar with these tools, please seek appropriate training/advise. " %}

## Introduction

The aim is to assemble the head unit of PANOPTES, which should look like this when complete.  A specific parts list as advised by the PANOPTES team can be found above including the tools needed for the build. These are the parts that have been determined to work well for the purposes of this project. However, modifications or swaps for other components are fine, but will not be supported by the PANOPTES team. Feedback on the parts/instructions is welcomed and encouraged.
