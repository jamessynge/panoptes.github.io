The [March, 2018 Parts List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CNgfsW2ko_KfVSitZQWOqfJAsT9YhMeeW1QI6GUinNA/edit)
is for the latest version of the design, and is slightly less
expensive than the January, 2017 design. Note that vendors will
change their prices and available parts from time to time,
so the prices are approximate, and not all of the listed parts may
be available, so substitutions may be required.

If you have any quesions about the parts please don't hesitate to ask!
