PANOPTES (Panoptic Astronomical Networked OPtical observatory for Transiting Exoplanets Survey) is a citizen science project which aims to build low cost, reliable, robotic telescopes which can be used to detect transiting exoplanets.  The hardware is designed to be standardized, using as many commercial off the shelf components as possible so that a Panoptes "unit" can be reproduced quickly and easily by students or amateurs.  In this way, many units can be deployed at many different sites to provide continuous and redundant sky coverage.  Panoptes is designed from the ground up to be a citizen science project which will involve the public in all aspects of the science, from data acquisition to data reduction.
