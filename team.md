The core PANOPTES team who participated in the development of the prototype and baseline units are:

### Olivier Guyon

<img style="float: left" height="180px" src="images/OlivierGuyon.png">Olivier is an astronomer at the Subaru Telescope and the University of Arizona. Olivier started astronomy as an avid amateur astronomer at age 10, and enjoys building and using telescopes for amateur astronomy. His professional interest in exoplanets and his taste for amateur astronomy and astrophotography led him and other like-minded amateur/professional astronomers to start the PANOPTES project. Olivier’s [professional website](www.naoj.org/staff/guyon) describes his exoplanet instrumentation work: coronagraphy, adaptive optics.
