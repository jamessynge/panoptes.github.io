title: PANOPTES Launches a New Web Site
layout: posts
---

There has been a lot of progress by the PANOPTES build team in Hawaii.  We realize, however, that not a lot of this has been visible to the outside world.  With such a small team it has been difficult to find time to update our web site in addition to the software and hardware development which we've been working on.

In an attempt to lower the boundary to getting out such updates, we are rebuilding our web site in the hopes that a simpler platform will make it easier for us to keep the outside world up to date on our progress.  This new web site (which you are reading now) has a much simpler layout and is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages/).
