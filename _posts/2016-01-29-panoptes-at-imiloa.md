title: PANOPTES at  ‘Imiloa!

PANOPTES is now at the [‘Imiloa Astronomy Center](http://www.imiloahawaii.org/) in Hilo! Our exhibit features this moving unit, a quick video slideshow on all our hard work, and two posters summarizing the PANOPTES project (see the photo below). January 27th was the unveiling of three of Imiloa’s new exhibits, PANOPTES being one of them.

This is unit #PAN004. It may not have the “brains” (computing system) of our other units but it has the eyes! There are two Canon DSLR cameras located in the head of the unit, a feature that makes PANOPTES unique among exoplanet detectors! This will also allow for the development of an interactive aspect to this exhibit in the near future.

Imiloa’s birthday is coming up soon! On February 21, the exhibit hall will be free. Come see this adorable unit and help give it a name! We’ll be hosting a naming contest at ‘Imiloa’s birthday event. The winning name will be chosen randomly from your suggestions.
