        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Due to the simplicity and low cost (an individual PANOPTES unit is targeted to
            cost about $5000 USD), a PANOPTES "unit" can be reproduced quickly and easily
            by students or amateur scientists. In this way, many units can be deployed at
            many different sites to provide continuous and redundant sky coverage. PANOPTES
            is designed from the ground up to be a citizen science project which will
            involve the public in all aspects of the science, from data acquisition to
            data reduction.

        <h2>Software / Hardware</h2>
        <p>
            The philosophy behind the
            <a href="panoptes_baseline_unit_description">PANOPTES hardware and software design</a>
            is to use as many commercial off the shelf (COTS) parts as possible as these are generally
            inexpensive and easily acquired. In addition, the PANOPTES design is kept as simple as possible
            as this makes the build process easier and means that the final product is more reliable.

        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>
            The PANOPTES community spans the world, from the founding members in Hawaii to
            designers, builders and scientists in Europe, Australia, and North and South America.
            We're looking forward to our members in Africa and Asia!
            We use a variety of means to communicate, including a
            <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact.html">Google Group</a> for announcements and a
            <a href="https://forum.projectpanoptes.org">forum for discussions</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            PANOPTES is also a platform. We encourage other groups to come up with
            projects which use PANOPTES data, hardware or software to address other
            scientific questions.
            For example, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AstroHuntsman/">The Huntsman Telephoto Array</a>
            is a project that is using the PANOPTES software to automate their observations.
