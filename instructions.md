# Building a PANOPTES Unit

{% include warning.html text="The baseline design is meant to be assembled by anyone with a basic knowledge of electronics, computers, and astronomy, and a taste for building things/tinkering. There is no need to machine parts, and only standard tools are required (you will need a drill, screwdrivers, voltmeter). All electronics are readily available, and only need to be mounted and wired together." %}


When assembling the electronics, use caution since you will be working with both AC and DC power.  Electrocution is a hazard!  If you have little or no prior experience assembling electronics, please work with someone who does.

## PANOPTES Build Instructions

The instructions linked below are still in development and should be considered to be at a beta level of readiness.  We will be updating these constantly as we build units and get feedback from the first generation of builders.  Please <a href="mailto:info@projectpanoptes.org">Contact Us</a> if you would like to build a unit and we will help you decide how to proceed.
